            <p>
                With a diverse professional background spanning various fields, 
                I bring a wealth of experience and expertise to the table. 
                Beginning my journey as a secondary teacher from 2020 to 2022,
                 I honed my skills in education and mentorship, fostering growth and development among students. 
                 Transitioning into the humanitarian sector, I served as a community-based facilitator in Nyumanzi Refugee Settlement in Uganda,
                  where I worked tirelessly to empower and uplift displaced communities, providing vital support and resources to those in need.

                Additionally, my role as a psychosocial worker in Uganda allowed me to delve deeper into the intricacies of mental health
                 and well-being, offering compassionate care and guidance to individuals facing challenges and adversity.
                  Currently, as a co-founder of Nile Fresh Vegetable, I am dedicated to driving positive change and innovation in the agricultural sector,
                   leveraging my passion for sustainable farming practices and commitment to delivering high-quality produce to local and global markets. 
                   Through these diverse experiences, I have developed a multifaceted skill set and a profound understanding of the importance of community engagement, 
                   social impact, and holistic development.
